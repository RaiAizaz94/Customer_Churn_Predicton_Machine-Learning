# Customer_Churn_Predicton_Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques, specifically Keras and Random Forest. Understanding churn can help businesses enhance customer retention strategies. 

Technologies Used:
Python: Programming language for data analysis and modeling.
Keras: For building and training deep learning models.
Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and machine learning.
Pandas, NumPy: For data manipulation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

Model Development:
Random Forest: For classification.
Keras Neural Network: For capturing complex patterns.

Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to assess model performance.
